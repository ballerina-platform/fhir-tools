# A Coding is a representation of a defined concept using a symbol from a defined "code system"
#
# + id - Unique id for inter-element referencing
# + extension - Additional content defined by implementations
# + system - Identity of the terminology system  
# + 'version - Version of the system - if relevant
# + code - Symbol in syntax defined by the system  
# + display - Representation defined by the system  
# + userSelected - If this coding was chosen directly by the user
