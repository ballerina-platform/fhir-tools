NAME
        ballerina-health - Generate a Ballerina package or template for a
        given health specification(eg.:FHIR implementation guides) files.

SYNOPSIS
        bal health fhir [-m | --mode] <package|template> [-o | --output] <output-location> \
                        <FHIR-specification-directory-path>
                        [-m | --mode] <package|template> <FHIR-specification-directory-path>

DESCRIPTION
        Generate a Ballerina package or template  with relevant records and types
        from given health specification(eg.:FHIR implementation guides) files.

        The generated Ballerina sources will be written into the provided
        output location.
        Make sure to add the directory path which contains FHIR specification
        as the last argument. It can contain either a directory which named
        after the implementation guide or a set of FHIR specification files.

        You can download FHIR specification files from the respective
        Implementation Guide official website. (Published list of
        Implementation Guides can be found in http://fhir.org/guides/registry/)

        The ballerina-health tool is compatible with Ballerina
        version 2201.7.0 (Swan Lake Update 7) onwards.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
            Print version information.

       -h, --help
            Print the usage details of a command.

COMMANDS
        fhir
            Refer to the FHIR specification when generating the Ballerina artifacts.

            OPTIONS
                    -m, --mode <mode-type>
                        Mode can be 'package' or 'template'. If the mode is set to 'package',
                        a Ballerina package will be generated including
                        all the records and types.
                        If the mode is set to ‘template’, tool will generate Ballerina templates
                        for each FHIR resource definition available in
                        the specified path. This is a MANDATORY input for fhir command.
                    -o, --output <output>
                        Location of the generated Ballerina artifacts. If this
                        path is not specified, the output will be written to
                        the same directory from which the command is run.
                    --package-name <fully-qualified-name-of-package>
                        Name of the Ballerina package to be generated.
                        Package name can be explicitly set using this argument.
                        Unless specified, default name of the implementation
                        guide will be taken to construct the name of the package.
                        Refer https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/#the-name-field
                    --org-name <org-name-of-the-package>
                        Organization name of the Ballerina package/template to be generated.
                        Refer https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/#the-org-field
                    --package-version <version-of-the-package>
                        Version of the Ballerina package/template to be generated.
                        Refer https://semver.org/
                    --dependency <custom-dependencies>
                        Dependency configuration of a custom package that needs to
                        be added to templates. This has to be entered as a JSON string.
                    --included-profile <profiles-to-included>
                        If only a specific profile/s needs to be generated as templates,
                        specify the profile URL as the value of this parameter.
                        This argument can be used more than once.
                    --excluded-profile <profiles-to-excluded>
                        If only a specific profile/s needs to be skipped when
                        generating templates, specify the profile URL
                        as the value of this parameter.
                        This argument can be used more than once.
                    --ig-package <ig-resource-package-used-for-template>
                        Fully qualified name of the Ballerina package containing IG resources.
                        This option can be used to generate templates specifically for the
                        resources in the given IG. The package name part of this value will be added
                        as a prefix to the template name.

            EXAMPLES
                    Generate a Ballerina package for the FHIR artifacts of USCore
