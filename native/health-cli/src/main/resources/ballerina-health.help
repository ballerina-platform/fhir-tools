NAME
        ballerina-health - Generate a Ballerina package or template for a
        given health specification (eg.:FHIR implementation guides) files.

SYNOPSIS
        bal health fhir [-m | --mode] package --package-name <package-name> \
                        <FHIR-specification-directory-path>
                        [-m | --mode] template --dependent-package <dependent-package> \
                        <FHIR-specification-directory-path>

DESCRIPTION
        Generate a Ballerina package or template with relevant records and types
        from a given health specification (eg.:FHIR implementation guides) files.

        The generated Ballerina sources will be written into the provided
        output location. Make sure to add the directory path which contains
        FHIR specification, as the last argument.

        You can download FHIR specification files from the respective
        Implementation Guide's official website. (Published list of
        Implementation Guides can be found in http://fhir.org/guides/registry/)

        The ballerina-health tool is compatible with Ballerina
        version 2201.8.1 (Swan Lake Update 8) onwards.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
            Print version information.

       -h, --help
            Print the usage details of a command.

COMMANDS
        fhir
            Refer to the FHIR specification when generating the Ballerina artifacts.

            OPTIONS
                    -m, --mode <mode-type>
                        Mode can be 'package' or 'template'. If the mode is set to
                        'package', a Ballerina package will be generated including all the
                        records and types. If the mode is set to ‘template’, tool will
                        generate Ballerina templates for each FHIR resource definition
                        available in the specified path. This is a MANDATORY input for fhir
                        command.

                    --package-name <name-of-package>
                        Only applicable in ‘package’ mode. Name of the Ballerina package
                        to be generated. This is a MANDATORY input in ‘package’ mode.
                        Refer https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/#the-name-field

                    --dependent-package <qualified-ballerina-package-name>
                        Only applicable in ‘template’ mode. Fully qualified name of the
                        published Ballerina package containing IG resources
                        [eg: <org>/<package>]. This option can be used to generate
                        templates specifically for the resources in the given IG. The
                        package name part of this value will be added as a prefix to the
                        template name. This is a MANDATORY input in ‘template’ mode.

                    -o, --output <output>
                        Location of the generated Ballerina artifacts. If this
                        path is not specified, the output will be written to
                        the same directory from which the command is run.

                    --org-name <org-name-of-the-package>
                        Organization name of the Ballerina package/template to be generated.
                        Refer https://ballerina.io/learn/package-references/#the-org-field

                    --package-version <version-of-the-package>
                        Version of the Ballerina package/template to be generated.
                        Refer https://semver.org/

                    --included-profile <profiles-to-included>
                        Only applicable in ‘template’ mode. If only a specific profile/s
                        needs to be generated as templates, specify the profile URL as the
                        value of this parameter. This argument can be used more than once.

                    --excluded-profile <profiles-to-excluded>
                        Only applicable in ‘template’ mode. If only a specific profile/s
                        needs to be skipped when generating templates, specify the
                        profile URL as the value of this parameter. This argument
                        can be used more than once.

            EXAMPLES
                    Generate a Ballerina package for the FHIR artifacts of USCore
                    implementation guide.
                        $ bal health fhir -m package --package-name uscore401 \
                        ./path_to_uscore_definitions

                    Generate a Ballerina package for the FHIR artifacts of
                    USCore implementation guide and write the output
                    to the given directory.
                        $ bal health fhir -m package --package-name uscore401 \
                        -o ./output_path ./path_to_uscore_definitions

                    Generate Ballerina templates for all the FHIR resource profiles
                    of USCore implementation guide.
                        $ bal health fhir -m template \
                        --dependent-package ballerinax/health.fhir.r4.uscore501 \
                        ./path_to_uscore_definitions
